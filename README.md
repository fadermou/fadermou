# Hey there, I'm Ferdaous 👋

Software engineering student at **1337 (42 Network)** within **UM6P** and currently working as a **Backend Developer Intern** at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University.

I build stuff that works in production and try to make it scale properly. Currently deep into geospatial platforms, real-time systems, and DevOps.

## 🔭 What I'm working on

**AFEOP** - A geospatial platform serving African researchers from MIT and UM6P for Earth observation data analysis. Built with Django, React, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, GeoServer, and deployed on Kubernetes with CI/CD pipelines via ArgoCD and Cloudflare Tunnel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Django Channels
- C++ (systems programming, networking)
- PostgreSQL, PostGIS
- API REST design & implementation

**Frontend**
- React, Redux
- JavaScript, TypeScript
- Responsive design, interactive mapping (Leaflet, ApexCharts)

**DevOps & Infrastructure**
- Docker, Kubernetes (k3s)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD)
- Cloudflare Tunnel, SSL/TLS configuration
- GitOps workflows

**Testing**
- Jest (unit tests)
- Cypress (end-to-end testing)
- Test automation & coverage

**Other stuff**
- GeoServer, geospatial data processing
- WebSockets, real-time communication
- Git, Linux

## 🚀 Some projects I've built

- **AFEOP**: Production geospatial platform with drought monitoring, soil moisture analysis, and interactive mapping. Comprehensive testing using Jest and Cypress
- **IRC Server**: Built from scratch in C++ with real-time communication and WebSocket support
- **Pong Multiplayer Game**: Real-time game using Django Channels and WebSockets
- **RAG Document Assistant**: Built with OpenAI GPT, Qdrant vector database, and Django

## 🌱 Currently learning

Kubernetes orchestration, vector databases, and improving my testing strategies with automated test pipelines.
